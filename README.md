# DT Management System
## Who?
This is an app written entirely by Pratyush Bindal for the benefit of the St CHristophers School of Bahrain DT Department.
## What?
The app is quite self explanitory. This is aimed at my schools DT Department so that they can effectivley manage their inventory without hassle
## Where?
This app is written for the Design Technology Department of the St Christopher's School of Bahrain.  
## When?
This app was written in the second academic half of 2023 and I am in year 9 at the time of writng
## Why?
I am quite passionate about Design Technology as a student and always push myself to be the best I cna be in the subject area. I always noticed that during a lesson and some item was needed, there was a chance that the item could not be found. It sparked the idea for an app that could not only benefit the students but the roughly 1700 students in the St Chris Senior School along with more students who arrive from the junior department.
## How?
The app was initally made as a console app in C#. When I relaized I wanted a complex, fast and efficient app, I learned the programming language of rust and how to make an app in Tauri. I then migrated my C# Terminal app to a Rust Terminal App and started working on a UI with HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (Javacript). The beauty of Tauri is that you can write a web application and a fully functional backend and it can be converted into app. This is similar to discord which is a wbe app that has been converted to an app using electron.js. This is a more well known framework but I have chose Tauri as it is nearly 4X Faster and much lighter on a computer. This is perfect for the potato computer we have at school which focus on GPU power rather than CPU Power or RAM.
